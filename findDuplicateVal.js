/*
I have an array where every number in the range 
1...n appears once except for one number which appears twice.
Write a function for finding the number that appears twice.

1. Create a hash where the key is the num, and the val is anything
2. If the num is already in the hash, return that number

ALSO since its a range we can use the triangular formula, subtract the sum of our array from that shiit and then know the answer.
(n^2 + n) / 2
